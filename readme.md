Write a function that takes three Integer numbers Number1, Number2, and Number3, and

determines if there is a mathematical operation that will make Number1 (operation) Number2

equal to Number3. If one or more of the 4 common mathematical operations (+,-,\*,/) can

complete the function, return the String representation of the mathematical function. If none of

the 4 mathematical operations can make the statement true, return the String "None".
